#Practical Machine Learning Project : Prediction Assignment Writeup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from Coursera's course Practical Machine Learning, as part of the Specialization in Data Science. It was built up in RStudio, using its knitr functions, meant to be published in html format.

This analysis meant to be the basis for the course quiz and a prediction assignment writeup. The main goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 participants performed some exercise as described below. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The machine learning algorithm described here is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data and the predictions are submitted in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.

##Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

##Data Loading and Exploratory Analysis
###Dataset Overview

The training data for this project are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment.

###Loading the Dataset

In this section, we download the data files from the Internet and load them into two data frames. We ended up with a training dataset and a 20 observations testing dataset that will be submitted to Coursera.


```{r }
library(caret)
```

```{r }
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)

# set the URL for the download
UrlTrain <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
UrlTest  <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"

# download the datasets
dt_training <- read.csv(url(UrlTrain))
dt_testing  <- read.csv(url(UrlTest))

```
###Cleaning the Data

In this section, we will remove all columns that contains NA and remove features that are not in the testing dataset. The features containing NA are the variance, mean and standard devition (SD) within each window for each feature. Since the testing dataset has no time-dependence, these values are useless and can be disregarded. We will also remove the first 7 features since they are related to the time-series or are not numeric.

```{r }
features <- names(dt_testing[,colSums(is.na(dt_testing)) == 0])[8:59]

# Only use features used in testing cases.
dt_training <- dt_training[,c(features,"classe")]
dt_testing <- dt_testing[,c(features,"problem_id")]

dim(dt_training); dim(dt_testing);

```

###Partitioning the Dataset

Following the recommendation in the course Practical Machine Learning, we will split our data into a training data set (60% of the total cases) and a testing data set (40% of the total cases; the latter should not be confused with the data in the pml-testing.csv file). This will allow us to estimate the out of sample error of our predictor.

```{r }
set.seed(12345)

inTrain <- createDataPartition(dt_training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
training <- dt_training[inTrain,]
testing <- dt_training[-inTrain,]

dim(training); dim(testing);
```

##Building the Decision Tree Model

Using Decision Tree, we shouldn't expect the accuracy to be high. In fact, anything around 80% would be acceptable.

```{r }
modFitDT <- rpart(classe ~ ., data = training, method="class")
fancyRpartPlot(modFitDT)


```

###Predicting with the Decision Tree Model

```{r}

set.seed(12345)

prediction <- predict(modFitDT, testing, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction, testing$classe)


```

##Building the Random Forest Model

Using random forest, the out of sample error should be small. The error will be estimated using the 40% testing sample. We should expect an error estimate of < 3%.

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
modFitRF <- randomForest(classe ~ ., data = training, ntree = 1000)

```

###Predicting with the Random Forest Model

```{r}
prediction <- predict(modFitRF, testing, type = "class")
confusionMatrix(prediction, testing$classe)

```

##Predicting on the Testing Data (pml-testing.csv)

###Decision Tree Prediction

```{r}
predictionDT <- predict(modFitDT, dt_testing, type = "class")
predictionDT

```

###Random Forest Prediction
```{r}

predictionRF <- predict(modFitRF, dt_testing, type = "class")
predictionRF
```

##Submission file

As can be seen from the confusion matrix the Random Forest model is very accurate, about 99%. Because of that we could expect nearly all of the submitted test cases to be correct. It turned out they were all correct.

Prepare the submission.

```{r}
pml_write_files = function(x){
  n = length(x)
  for(i in 1:n){
    filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
    write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
  }
}

pml_write_files(predictionRF)
```
